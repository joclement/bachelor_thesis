RaLaNS INSTALLATION GUIDE

First install all the needed software and packages (you have to be ROOT for pretty much every step):
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ python python-numpy python-matplotlib python-pp python-setuptools python-lxml subversion python-opengl python-pygame python-pip make

Installation of the utm package (for transformation of coordinates) is not possible through apt-get:
pip install utm

Change into the directory */ralans/src/launcher and compile the software with make, go back to */ralans.
If there is the following Error:
#error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support is currently experimental, and must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
Uncomment the compiler options behind CFLAGS in */ralans/src/launcher/Makefile

Now you should be good to go:
python run.py inputfiles/small_street_flat.osm name='example'

you can get a 2d result view with:
python viewer2d.py outputfiles/small_street_flat_example.zip

You may find more examples in EXAMPLE.txt




If there is an error with multiarray not found, you might have an old version of pp, make sure, you have the following version  -  On Ubuntu 14.04 or higher, this did not happen:
pp (Parallel Python) 1.6.4  (might be available on http://www.parallelpython.com/downloads/pp/pp-1.6.4.tar.gz)
manual installation is possible the same way as for utm:
cd ..
wget http://www.parallelpython.com/downloads/pp/pp-1.6.4.tar.gz
tar -xzf pp-1.6.4.tar.gz
cd pp-1.6.4
sudo python setup.py install
