This file contains some sample commands to run the computations via the command
line:

If you want to change the settings of your run, go into the configfiles and just
change some of the settings there.

!!!
Keep in mind to change the path to the correct data files to run the
computation, the are included in this CD. Otherwise the software won't find the
data.
!!!

!!!
All these commands need to be executed in the src folder to match the relativ
path to the python and the config file. For other folders the commands need to
be changed.

to run the genetic algorithm with a fixed number of nodes:
python3 start.py ../configfiles/garf_default.cfg

to run the genetic algorithm with a flexible number of nodes:
python3 start.py ../configfiles/garflex_default.cfg

to run the local search with a fixed number of nodes:
python3 local_search.py ../configfiles/lsrf.cfg

to run the greedy algorithm:
python3 local_search_flexible.py ../configfiles/lsrflex.cfg

to run the random search algorithm with a fixed number of nodes:
python3 random_search.py ../configfiles/rsrf.cfg

to run the random search algorithm with a flexible number of nodes:
python3 random_search.py ../configfiles/rsrflex.cfg
